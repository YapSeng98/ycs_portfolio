        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><strong> February 2021 - June 2023</strong>
            <br>
            I hold a bachelor’s degree in Business Information Systems from UTAR, Malaysia. After completing my
            internship at YTL Cement Shared Services SDN BHD, I chose to stay and further explore its operations, drawn
            by the positive work environment, supportive colleagues, and the company’s focus on innovation and growth. I
            served as a Junior Developer, where I honed my skills in application development, problem-solving, and user
            support.
            <br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>July 2023 - Present</strong>
            <br>
            I have been working as an Application Developer at Activants Singapore. In this role, my
            primary responsibility is developing a module that functions as a Business Process Management (BPM) system
            using the Decisions platform. I collaborate closely with stakeholders to gather requirements, refine process
            flows, and design user interfaces that align with business needs, ensuring efficiency and user satisfaction.
            This role allows me to leverage my technical expertise and passion for creating solutions that drive
            organizational success.
